Reflective analysis: Vancouver is amongst the largest cities of Canada and linked by various passenger rail services. However, only a few maps show all passenger rail routes on
a single map which link Metro Vancouver with the adjacent Fraser Valley. So the purpose of this map is to show all of such routes and display where the rail lines start 
paralleling water bodies. This information is intended for anyone who wishes to take a little scenic rail tour of Metro Vancouver covering the routes on both sides of the Fraser 
River. The rail routes shown have at least one connection between the Fraser Valley and the City of Vancouver. The West Coast Express is a commuter rail line which operates on 
the tracks owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway, linking Vancouver with Mission, BC. The service is operated by TransLink, a statutory body responsible for the regional 
transportation of Metro Vancouver. As such the data used to map the route and stations of the West Coast Express came from the “TransLink Transit GIS Data”. Canada’s intercity
passenger rail operator VIA Rail operates, “The Canadian”, a trans-continental passenger rail service linking Vancouver with Toronto, operating primarily over the tracks owned 
by Canadian National Railway. VIA Rail has a few stops in the Fraser Valley, but for our purposes I chose to strictly show the route up to Abbotsford/Mission following the 
maximum length of the West Coast Express route. I mapped the VIA Rail route myself in Mapbox Studio based on the Amtrak/VIA Live Map, and double checked the route with the 
Canadian Rail Atlas.


Since the only features I wanted to show were the rail lines, stations and the water bodies they follow, I started with a Monochrome design for my layout. 
This allowed me to somewhat blend most of the roads, transit services, parks, and other distinct features in the background. I gave the water bodies in my map layout a teal colour
to make them more apparent and to show more clearly where the rail routes parallel any water bodies. This information can also help the passengers/tourists decide which side of 
the train they wish to take their seats on and where potential photographic opportunities may exist. The West Coast Express route was shown in purple since the train itself 
carries a purple livery, and the text within the trains logo is also in the same colour. VIA Rail’s route is shown in a yellowish-orange colour since VIA Rail’s logo is in the 
same colour. All stations are shown as blue dots. When we zoom into the map we are able to see the names of the train stations and other important landmarks of the Metro Vancouver
and Fraser Valley Region.
